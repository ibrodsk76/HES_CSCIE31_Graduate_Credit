# Graduate Credit Assignment

For my Graduate Credit Assignment, I chose to explore the topic of managing asynchronous calls covered in Week 8’s module “Week 8: Asynchronous Code: Callbacks, Promises, async/await”:

This topic can cause a lot of confusion. Even when I thought I understood the difference between synchronous and asynchronous calls and understod the syntax of callbacks, promises, and awaits, I often found myself getting unexpected results when it came to the order of execution. Completing this exercise helped me to understand this topic a lot better.

For this assignment, I came up with the practice set that would help the students to learn and better understand the asynchronous calls and various methods of managing them.

The following files are available in git repository:
Files provided to students:
Assigment.docx - assigment description
wrong.js - example of non-working code
right.js - example of working code

Solution files:
solution-callback.js - working code using callbacks
solution-promise.js - working code using promises
solution-wait.js - working code using await
