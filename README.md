# Graduate Credit Assignment

For my Graduate Credit Assignment, I chose to explore the topic of managing asynchronous calls covered in Week 8’s module “Week 8: Asynchronous Code: Callbacks, Promises, async/await”:

This topic can cause some confusion, and even when I thought I understood the difference between synchronous and asynchronous calls, and understand the synapsis of callbacks, promises, and awaits, I often found myself getting unexpected results when it came to the order the commands are executed. Completing this exercise helped me to understand this topic much better.

For this assignment, I came up with the practice set that would help the students to learn and better understand the asynchronous calls.
